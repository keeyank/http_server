    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India. He studied law in London and became a barrister in 1891. His experiences with racial discrimination in South Africa shaped his future path as a political and social reformer.</p>

    <h2>Non-violent Civil Disobedience</h2>
    <p>Gandhi developed and practiced the principle of Satyagraha - non-violent civil disobedience. He led nationwide campaigns in India for various social causes and for achieving Swaraj or self-rule.</p>

    <h2>Indian Independence Movement</h2>
    <p>Gandhi played a crucial role in India's struggle for independence from British rule. He led famous movements such as the Salt March (1930) and the Quit India Movement (1942), inspiring millions to join the non-violent resistance against colonial rule.</p>

    <h2>Legacy</h2>
    <p>Known as "Mahatma" (great soul), Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence has influenced civil rights movements worldwide. He was assassinated on January 30, 1948, but his legacy continues to inspire people around the globe in their struggles for freedom and equality.</p>

    <p><em>Note: This is a brief overview. Gandhi's life and work are complex subjects that have been extensively studied and debated.</em></p>
